# Product Brief

## One line

An in-session workspace for tabletop RPG game masters: campaign material on the left,
an assistant grounded in that material on the right.

## The problem

Running a session means holding too much in your head at once. A GM juggles a rulebook,
an adventure module, their own notes, a cast of NPCs, faction politics, and a quest log —
while improvising in real time in front of players. The failure mode is not *lack of
information*; it is **retrieval latency**. The answer is in the PDF. Finding it takes
ninety seconds, and the table is waiting.

Existing tools solve half of it. Note apps store material but cannot answer questions
about it. Generic AI chat answers questions but invents rules that are not in *your*
books, which is worse than useless at the table.

## The product

DM Assistant helps a game master **build** a campaign and **run** it, with an AI that does
both jobs without confusing them.

Two modes, deliberately separate ([ADR-0012](adr/adr-0012-two-ai-modes.md)):

**Research** — the side panel, available while you work. It behaves like NotebookLM:
answers **only** from your indexed material, cites the source, and says plainly when your
documents do not cover the question. This is where you ask rules questions mid-session.

**Creative** — its own page. Draft adventures, NPCs, factions, regions, and dialogue. It
knows your campaign, so new content fits the world it is joining. Everything it produces is
a **draft you confirm**, never a silent write.

A third mode, **in character**, opens from any character: their portrait and name replace
the assistant's, their sheet and notes become context, and you talk to them directly.

Around all of it sits the session-running workspace the design defines: NPCs, players,
factions, a quest log, session records, and a knowledge graph of how everyone relates.

### Who it is for

Game masters running live sessions, primarily at a table or over video, for systems like
D&D 2024 and Traveller 2e. Single-user, local-first. Not a player-facing tool, not a
virtual tabletop, not a campaign-sharing platform.

### The core loop

1. **Prepare** — upload rulebooks, modules, and notes; they are extracted and indexed.
2. **Populate** — record NPCs, players, factions, and quests for the campaign.
3. **Run** — during a session, ask the assistant, consult the graph, update quest state.
4. **Record** — write a session log; it becomes searchable material for next time.

## Product principles

**PRIN-001 — Research mode is grounded and never invents.**
In Research mode the assistant answers from indexed material only. When material does not
cover a question, it says so rather than filling the gap.

This is a rule *about Research mode*, not about the product. Creative mode invents — that
is its purpose. The two are separate surfaces so the distinction is structural rather than
something the GM must infer ([ADR-0012](adr/adr-0012-two-ai-modes.md)).

**PRIN-006 — The GM always knows which mode produced something.**
An invention mistaken for a retrieved fact eventually becomes canon. Modes are visually
distinct, named in their headers, and recorded with each message, so provenance survives
past the moment it was on screen.

**PRIN-002 — Extraction is deterministic.**
Text extraction and parsing use libraries, not language models. This keeps ingestion
testable against fixtures, cheap, and reproducible. AI acts only on already-indexed data.
See [adr/adr-0002-deterministic-extraction.md](adr/adr-0002-deterministic-extraction.md).

**PRIN-003 — The session is the priority.**
The workspace is used live, with players waiting. Interactions target under 300ms.
Nothing blocks the GM mid-session; long work (document processing) happens in the
background with visible status.

**PRIN-004 — Local-first, with real accounts.**
Data lives on the GM's machine, in SQLite. There is no sync and no sharing between users,
but v1 has **real authentication** — signup, login, Google OAuth, and password reset, all
built in the application rather than delegated to a provider
([ADR-0008](adr/adr-0008-own-auth-v1.md)).

That is a deliberate choice: this project is a learning exercise as well as a tool, and a
managed auth provider would hide exactly the mechanism worth understanding. Hosting for
other game masters stays a possible end state; with real users in v1, it is a deployment
question rather than a rewrite.

**PRIN-005 — The interface is calm.**
Dark, low-chrome, image-forward. The tool sits beside a game; it should not compete with
it for attention.

## What success looks like

The MVP is successful if a GM can:

1. Upload a rulebook and see it reach `Indexed` status without intervention.
2. Ask a rules question mid-session and get a correct answer grounded in that book,
   fast enough not to stall the table.
3. Keep their campaign's NPCs, factions, and quests in the workspace instead of scattered
   notes, and find them faster than before.
4. Draft an NPC or an adventure hook in Creative mode, edit the proposal, and save it — with
   no doubt about which parts came from their books and which the model invented.

If retrieval is not trustworthy, nothing else in the product matters — every other
feature assumes the GM believes the answers.

## Explicit non-goals

- **Not a virtual tabletop.** No maps, tokens, initiative tracking, or dice rolling.
- **Not player-facing.** No player logins, no shared views, no handouts.
- **Not a rules engine.** It retrieves and explains rules; it does not adjudicate them.
- **Not a source of truth about your rules.** Creative mode invents; only Research mode's
  cited answers should be trusted as coming from your books.
- **Not multi-tenant.** No hosting, no organisations, no collaboration in v1.
